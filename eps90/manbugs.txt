This file lists all known errors in the revision 9A manual for
Epsilon 9.0.  All these errors have been corrected in the online
documentation.

The description of the tex-look-back variable was omitted from the
printed manual.

One section of the manual suggested pressing <Tab> to edit the
current line when viewing a history or completion list.  This only
works in Epsilon for DOS or OS/2.  The Alt-E key works in all
environments.

The descriptions of the c-mode-mouse-to-tag and mouse-goes-to-tag
variables didn't make it clear that they applied to Epsilon for DOS
and Epsilon for OS/2, not Epsilon for Windows.

The OS/2 variation of the -ka flag was omitted from the printed
manual.

The description of the select-help-files command now refers to the
winhelp-display-contents variable.

The description of the tex-environment command now mentions the
latex.env file.

The description of the tex-left-brace command was corrected.

When the beep-frequency variable is zero, Epsilon for DOS or OS/2
actually flashes the mode lines of each window, not the entire screen.

The documentation for the clipboard-access variable describes how
killing and yanking commands avoid automatically accessing the
Windows clipboard when run from a keyboard macro.  The documentation
for the yank command now describes auto-indenting and clipboard
access.

The description of the OS/2 version of the do_interrupt() primitive
didn't explain how the return value when calling 32-bit functions
could be retrieved.

The description of the get_strnone() subroutine was corrected.
