New features from Epsilon 6.5 to Epsilon 7.0:

Syntax highlighting.

Command history: Recall previous responses at any prompt with Alt-<Up>.

Extended file patterns.  Grep, dired, file-query-replace on files in
multiple directories, etc.

Cut and paste from Epsilon directly to the MS-Windows clipboard
with normal Epsilon commands.

VESA and Ultravision video support in DOS.

Dired can sort its listings in many different ways, and has new
subcommands to copy and move files.

Replace text in multiple files, even multiple directories.

The new edit-variables command makes it easier to set a variable.

Brief emulation.

New compile-buffer command.

New variables let you show text in the echo area when Epsilon's
idle.

Epsilon now caches partial line counts, so determining the current
line number is now very fast, even in big files.

Epsilon can now use distinct cursor shapes when the cursor appears
in virtual space (between characters).

Incremental search now highlights the match.

The new view-process command displays compiler output in a pop-up
window.

Improved autoloading.

C and C++ indenting is smarter and has several new customization
options.

Many convenient new commands, including delete-matching-lines,
keep-matching-lines, tabify-buffer, untabify-buffer.

New printing commands.

You can create keyboard macros that pause and let you edit text
before continuing.

Epsilon now distinguishes between shifted cursor keys and grey
keys, and the unshifted variety.
